JavaScript Compiler Interpreter
================
This is a very basic LL(1) grammar parser capable of parsing any grammar it is given.  This is the first compiler I've written and it is extremely primitive.  I am putting it in the public space so that others can use it, study it, and fix or improve it.  I have created no documentation for it, but others are more than welcome to.

TODO:
============
-epsilon rules just use last rule--can we match instead?

-find better handling of overlapping token patterns

-add caching to first and follow
